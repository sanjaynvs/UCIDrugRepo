191290,Pentasa,Crohn's Disease,"""I had Crohn&#039;s with a resection 30 years ago and have been mostly in remission since.  Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&#039;t found one that I can handle.  Asacol gave me such serious body aching and fatigue that I could not function.  Pentasa immediately gave me heart palpitations and arrhythmias so I had to discontinue it.""",4,06-Jul-13,8
221320,Dextromethorphan,Cough,"""Have a little bit of a lingering cough from a cold. Not giving me much trouble except keeps me up at night. I heard this was good so I took so I could get some sleep. Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&#039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&#039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.  Now I wish I had done that first because I probably wouldn&#039;t have taken it. So, while it worked for my cough I still didn&#039;t get any sleep due to the stomach issues.""",4,07-Sep-17,1
81890,Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.""",9,19-Jan-17,20
